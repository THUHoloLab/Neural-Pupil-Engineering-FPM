# Neural Pupil Engineering for off-axis Fourier Ptychography
<br>
This is the MATLAB code for the implementation of neural pupil engineering FPM (NePE-FPM), an optimization framework for FPM reconstruction for off-axis areas. <br>
<br>
NePE-FPM engineers the pupil function using an implicit neural representation with multi-resolution hash encoding, enabling continuous, smooth shifting of the pupil function without introducing additional physical parameters. <br>
<br>
By optimizing a feature-domain loss function, NePE-FPM adaptively filters Fourier-space information from low-resolution measurements, achieving accurate off-axis reconstruction without modeling off-axis propagation.<br>
