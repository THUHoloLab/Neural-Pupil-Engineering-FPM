# Neural Pupil Engineering for off-axis Fourier Ptychography
<br>
This is the MATLAB code for the implementation of neural pupil engineering FPM (NePE-FPM), an optimization framework for FPM reconstruction for off-axis areas. <br>
<br>
NePE-FPM engineers the pupil function using an implicit neural representation with multi-resolution hash encoding, enabling continuous, smooth shifting of the pupil function without introducing additional physical parameters. <br>
<br>
By optimizing a feature-domain loss function, NePE-FPM adaptively filters Fourier-space information from low-resolution measurements, achieving accurate off-axis reconstruction without modeling off-axis propagation.<br>

### Neural Pupil Engineering FPM (NePE-FPM) Reconstruction

This implementation provides both conventional and neural-enhanced reconstruction methods for Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy:

**Available Methods:**

- **Conventional FPM with Feature-Domain Loss**: 
  Execute `cuFPM_recon_FDFPM.m` for traditional FPM reconstruction utilizing [feature-domain](https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202413975) optimization criteria.

- **Neural Pupil Engineering FPM (NePE-FPM)**:
  Run `cuFPM_recon_NePE.m` to perform reconstruction with our novel neural-enhanced pupil engineering approach.

### Fitting a single image using MATLAB-NGP

For researchers interested in neural graphics primitives implementation, we provide **MATLAB-NGP** - a MATLAB adaptation of NVIDIA's Instant Neural Graphics Primitives ([Instant-NGP](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp)). 

This implementation enables efficient single image reconstruction through coordinate-based neural representations:

**Key Features:**
- Multi-resolution hash encoding for compact feature representation
- GPU-accelerated inference and training
- Modular architecture compatible with MATLAB's deep learning framework

**Implementation Details:**
The complete MATLAB-NGP framework is available in the [Instant-NGP-MATLAB directory](https://github.com/THUHoloLab/Neural-Pupil-Engineering-FPM/tree/main/Instant-NGP-MATLAB), including example usage and pre-trained models for rapid deployment.

## Key Features

- **Dual Learning Strategy**: Simultaneously optimizes neural hash encodings and physical wavefront parameters
- **Hybrid Architecture**: MATLAB for control flow with CUDA-accelerated kernels for efficient computation  
- **Differentiable Physics**: End-to-end differentiable pipeline enabling gradient-based optimization
- **Off-axis Reconstruction**: Reconstruction of off-axis FOV using FPM can be achieved with high-speed, and high-quality. 
<br>

<!-- TOC --><a name="how-it-works"></a>
## How It Works

The system employs two parallel learning streams:
1. **Neural Path**: Learnable hash tables provide efficient coordinate-based representations
2. **Physical Path**: Optimizable sample wavefronts capture physical light propagation

Both streams converge through a differentiable FPM forward model, enabling joint optimization of neural representations and optical parameters for high-quality phase retrieval and image reconstruction.

The system follows a hybrid MATLAB-CUDA architecture for efficient forward and backward computations.
